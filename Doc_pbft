PBFTNode Struct:

Represents a node in the PBFT network.
ID: Each node has a unique identifier within the network.
TotalNodes: Indicates the total number of nodes in the PBFT network.
PrepareMsgs: A data structure to store Prepare messages indexed by sequence number. Prepare messages are sent by nodes to signal agreement on a PrePrepare message.
CommitMsgs: A data structure to store Commit messages indexed by sequence number. Commit messages are sent by nodes to signal agreement on Prepare messages.
mu: A mutex used for synchronizing access to shared data structures, ensuring thread safety in concurrent operations.

Messages:

PrePrepareMessage:

Block: Represents a block in the blockchain, typically containing transaction data.
View: Indicates the current view of the PBFT system. Views are used to manage the consensus process and handle view changes.
Seq: Sequence number of the message, used to order messages within a view.

PrepareMessage:

NodeID: ID of the node sending the message.
View: Current view of the PBFT system.
Seq: Sequence number of the message.
Digest: Digest of the block. Digests are cryptographic hashes computed from block data, used to uniquely identify blocks.

CommitMessage:

NodeID: ID of the node sending the message.
View: Current view of the PBFT system.
Seq: Sequence number of the message.
Digest: Digest of the block.

Explanation of the Code:

The code provides an implementation of a PBFT node and message types used in the PBFT consensus algorithm.
Each PBFT node maintains state information such as its ID, the total number of nodes in the network, and message storage for Prepare and Commit messages.
PrePrepare, Prepare, and Commit messages are defined to facilitate the consensus process in the PBFT algorithm.
The PBFTNode struct methods handle message reception and processing, including broadcasting Prepare and Commit messages and handling their reception.
This implementation serves as a foundation for a distributed consensus algorithm where nodes work together to achieve agreement on the order of transactions in a blockchain.
